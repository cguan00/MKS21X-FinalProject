## Development Log

- Today, I set up the Square class, Board class, and abstract Piece class. I created the fields for all classes, a constructor in the Board class, and the abstract method in the Piece class. Most of my time today was spent figuring out how to use the branches in GitHub. Even after trying the tutorials posted on the StuyCS website, I had to watch multiple YouTube videos to figure it out. It took many tries to merge and push correctly.

- Initially, I wrote a toString method in Board.java so that when the class is ran, it would print out an 8 by 8 board with numbers and letters on the sides to signify the row and column. However, later on, I realized that the toString should be in the Game class instead, and proceeded to create the Game class and move the method over. Besides the toString method, the Game class also has two fields. I also set up the Move class with four fields and the Player class with one field and one constructor.

- During the in class work period, I worked on the different Piece classes in the pieceChristy branch. I created classes for all six of the different game pieces, which extended the abstract Piece class. Tomorrow, I will continue to work on the Piece classes by filling in the necessary abstract methods.
