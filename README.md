## Development Log

- Today, I set up the Square class and the Board class. I created the fields for both classes and a constructor in the Board class. Most of my time today was spent figuring out how to use the branches in GitHub. Even after trying the tutorials posted on the StuyCS website, I had to watch multiple YouTube videos to figure it out. It took many tried to merge and push correctly.
